# hello-world
This is my introductory repository
Hi, my name is Russell, and I'm new to the computer programming scene
I'm just putting this up as an intro to my status on here. I'll try to make
different projects, like some from Processing JS and other things. I'd like to
try and show alot more stuff when I get the chance. Hopefully, this will attract 
companies who are looking for someone like me. Until then, Thank You very much!!! :)
